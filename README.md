# Marbleco

This project aims to automate the main processes in a marble factory by implementing a comprehensive system. The factory's workflow involves the arrival and unloading of marble blocks, which are then processed by cutting machines to produce marble slices. Multiple cutters are available in the factory, and the final step involves loading the marble slices onto trucks.

The key features of the system are as follows:

1. Dashboard for General Manager:
  * A dashboard screen will provide the general manager with an overview of the factory's operations.
  * The dashboard will display the status of each arrived block, including the number of slices produced from each block.
  * The total amount of slices produced will be presented on a daily, weekly, and monthly basis.

2. Phases and Manager Functions:
  * The factory's workflow will be divided into three phases: (1) arriving and unloading, (2) cutting, and (3) loading marble slices.
  * Each phase will have dedicated functions and status updates accessible to the respective managers.

3. Worker Progress Tracking:
  * Each worker will have a dedicated screen to record their progress in each operation.
  * This screen will enable workers to update their progress in real-time.

4. Front-End and Back-End Functionality:
  * All screens, including the dashboard, manager functions, and worker progress tracking, will be fully operated from both the front-end and back-end.
  * JavaScript will be utilized for front-end validation to ensure data integrity and user-friendly interaction.
